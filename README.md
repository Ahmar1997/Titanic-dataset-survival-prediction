## Project Description
In this project, we apply Logistic Regression to the Titanic dataset to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on features such as age, gender, ticket class, and more. Logistic Regression is a popular machine learning algorithm for binary classification tasks, making it an ideal choice for this dataset.
